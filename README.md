## News Analysis System

**News Analysis System**  

This project develops a News Analysis System that automatically collects news articles from various websites using web scraping. It performs sentiment analysis for news' intensity analysis as positive, negative or neutral with its intensity scores and classifies articles as real or fake, providing the probability of each classification. The system supports two languages, English and Hindi, allowing for broader applicability. The results are displayed in an interactive dashboard, where patterns in real and fake news are analyzed. A user-friendly interface is created using Streamlit to facilitate easy visualization and exploration of the analysis results.


 

## Features

- Automated Data Collection
- Sentiment Analysis of news in positive,negative and neutral
- Pattern Analysis using clustering algorithms
- Real or Fake News Classification
- Two languages adaptability
- Interactive Dashboard



## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a CSV file containing news articles collected through web scraping from various news websites. This file includes relevant information such as article titles, content, publication dates, and labels indicating whether the news is classified as real or fake. The dataset serves as the primary input for performing sentiment analysis and classification tasks in the News Analysis System.
